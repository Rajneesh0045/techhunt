          It wasnt unusual for the king of Britannia to be in his study for days together. After the meeting with the informant he took to his room and didnt come out for a week
           No one knew what he was upto nor did anyone have the guts to find out. The only one who was ever allowed to enter during that time was his dear son Lelouch.
           But when his body was found, his body was cold out , blood had already dried up and the corpse was smelling.
          Neo now wanted to find out when he died. Was the date and time of the death scripted? Was the next clue (if he did find out when his father died)the month in words and the date in numbers?No one knew!
