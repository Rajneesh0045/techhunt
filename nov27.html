          Now all that was missing was an evidence. Neo went through all the events of that unfortunate day. But he couldnt find anything. So he went back to his dad's room unseen.He went through his desk. And there he found a video and a note.
          It didnt make any sense to him. Why would the note say," See the video guess the clue. I would remove 'search' if i were you. This word gives you a set of digits. Lights were first "on" then were switched "off" and then switched "on" again! Write in words and there you go".
